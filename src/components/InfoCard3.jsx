        <h2>do i really need this class</h2>
        <p>yes!! i know someone might have told you about the 'hot new framework' that will earn
           you 100k total comp after 6 weeks. but before we can learn that stuff, we need to learn the basics. 
           this class will give you the foundation needed to build massive projects in the future.
