# cs 1115
this is a course website for [cs 1115.](https://websql.brooklyn.cuny.edu/courses/ShowCourse.do?redirect=/acad/course_info.jsp&dsc=CISC.&crs_num=1115&div=U) cs 1115, "intro to programming using java", is the first computer science course taught in brooklyn college. 

it's hosted at https://cis-1115.vercel.app/


## what is in it
this website has information about the course.

it also has resources for students to learn class material. if you're struggling in the class, just hop on here for a quick refresher. if you already know everything and just wanna brush up that's fine too.

i know there's a million java tutorials online. but isn't it nice to have something specifically designed for your school?

even if you're not in brooklyn college, i hope you get some value out of my little site.

## why did i make this

a lot of students fail 1115... not because they're dumb, or the professor sucks. for material this hard, things happen. 

i made this site as a resource to help out students. it'll give them clear info about the course and interactive study materials.

this is project done to complete [cs 4900](https://www.sci.brooklyn.cuny.edu/4900/), the final class i have to take as a computer science major at brooklyn college. if all goes well, i should be walking down the aisle may 23rd, degree in hand, and this on my resume.

the project's official name is "CS 1115 Reimagined." however, internally i call the site "cs 1115", and the repo is called "cs 1115." 

## who are u
my name is shawn evans! i'm a senior at brooklyn college right now. 

i'm a cs peer mentor and [blmi](https://www.instagram.com/bcblmi/?hl=en) peer mentor at brooklyn college. 

as a cs peer mentor, i work with professors in their classes to help out their students. the amount of time i spent helping other students with their coding work, was one of my motivations for wanting to make this. 

as a blmi peer mentor, i work with underrepresented students. i talk to them about mental health and ways to succeed academically. 

i'm not the "best" academically - i've gotten some high grades, some low grades. but what i have always had is a passion and drive for helping other people. i want to be the person i wish i had when i would struggle with classes.
