# what is this

this is a course website for [cs 1115.](https://websql.brooklyn.cuny.edu/courses/ShowCourse.do?redirect=/acad/course_info.jsp&dsc=CISC.&crs_num=1115&div=U) cs 1115, "intro to programming using java", is the first computer science course taught in brooklyn college. 

a lot of students fail it... not because they're dumb, or the professor sucks. for material this hard, things happen. in addition to course info, this site will have custom learning materials for the course.

this is project done to complete "cs 4900", the final class i have to take as a computer science major at brooklyn college. if all goes well, i should be walking down the aisle may 23rd, degree in hand, and this on my resume.

the project's official name is "CS 1115 Reimagined." however, internally i call the site "cs 1115", and the repo is called "cs 1115."
