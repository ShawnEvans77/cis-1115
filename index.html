    <h1>brooklyn college cs 1115</h1>
    <p>welcome to cs 1115! we're a bit of a wip now. give me until may 23rd huh?</p>

    <h2>what is cs 1115</h2>
    <p>
        cs1115 is the first programming course you'll take as a brooklyn college student. it'll be a fun intro
        to the world of coding using java. i hope you will enjoy it.
    </p>

    <h3>is it hard?</h3>
    <p>
        it's not a hard class necessarily. put in the time & effort and you will pass. pls do not copy & paste
        your homework into chatgpt. that's the quickest way to fail. talk to your professor. talk to your students.
        use your books. there are people out there who want to help you. don't cheap, it's just gonna mess you up.
