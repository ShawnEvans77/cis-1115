    <p>
        cs1115 is the first programming course you'll take as a brooklyn college student.<br>

    </p>

    <h3>is it hard?</h3>
    <p>
        it's not a hard class necessarily. put in the time & effort and you will pass. <b><em>pls do not copy & paste
        your homework into chatgpt.</em></b> <i>that's the quickest way to fail</i>. talk to your professor. talk to your students.
        use your books. there are people out there who want to help you. don't cheap, it's just gonna mess you up.
    </p>

    <h3>what's after cs 1115</h3>
    <p>
        after cs 1115 you'll get into the rest of your cs degree! algorithims. databases. game development. web development. 
        if you're able to power through this class, you have a lot of things to look forward to. 

        if you're not a cs major and just doing this for an elective, i do still hope you consider doing cs stuff. it's a fun skill to know on the side.

        maybe it'll make your resume more pretty if you know it.
