    <p>1The delegates of the United Colonies of New Hampshire; Massachusetts Bay; Rhode Island and Providence Plantations; Connecticut; New York; New Jersey; Pennsylvania; New Castle,
        Kent, and Sussex, in Delaware; Maryland; Virginia; North Carolina, and South Carolina, In Congress assembled at Philadelphia,
        Resolved on the 10th of May, 1776, to recommend to the respective assemblies and conventions of the United Colonies, where no
        government sufficient to the exigencies of their affairs had been
        established, to adopt such a government as should, in the opinion of the representatives of the people, best conduce to the happiness and safety of their constituents in particular, and of
        America in general. A preamble to this resolution, agreed to on
        the 15th of May, stated the intention to be totally to suppress
        the exercise of every kind of authority under the British crown.
        On the 7th of June, certain resolutions respecting independency
        were moved and seconded. On the 10th of June it was resolved,
        that a committee should be appointed to prepare a declaration

        the following order: Mr. Jefferson, Mr. J. Adams, Mr. Franklin,
        Mr. Sherman, Mr. R. R. Livingston. On the 11th of June a resolution was passed to appoint a committee to prepare and digest
        the form of a confederation to be entered into between the colonies, and another committee to prepare a plan of treaties to be
        proposed to foreign powers. On the 12th of June, it was resolved,
        that a committee of Congress should be appointed by the name
        of a board of war and ordnance, to consist of five members. On
        the 25th of June, a declaration of the deputies of Pennsylvania,
